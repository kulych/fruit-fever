Fruit Fever!
============
Simple, fast and funny 2D singleplayer game

Bunny is trying to live for as long as possible.
Fruit is falling down from the sky. Bunny doesn't like fruit.
If a fruit hits Bunny, game is over. If fruit hits the ground the hit block is destroyed.
Bunny can move only on blocks. Bunny can shoot and destroy the falling fruit.
A fruit can carry a bonus. Bonus is activated if the carrying fruit is destroyed by Bunny's shot.

Controls:

1. Left, Right - Bunny movement
2. Space - shoot!
3. Q,W,E - Cheats (if turned on) that give Bunny a gun

Bonuses:
1. Guns (GIANT ROTATING CARROT, Railgun, Machingun)
2. Block fixers (yellow block fixes everything, normal block fixes only one)

Multimedia:
- Background music made in Milkytracker
- Gun sounds made by my vocal chords :-)
- All pictures made by me 
- Font from http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net/
